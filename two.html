            A Tale of Two APIs
        </h1>



        <div class="examplebox">
            <p>
                In this example, I will try to show the difference between two 
                very different APIs.
            </p>
            <p> 
                As far as the HTML is concerned, or even what you see, things should
                be very similar. But under the hood, they work in very different ways.
            </p>
           <canvas id="canvas1" width="250px" height="200px" style="border:1px solid #000"></canvas>
           <svg id="svg1" width="250px" height="200px" style="border:1px solid #000"></svg>
           <p>
                Go look at the Javascript. 
                You'll see that the left box is written using 
                an immediate mode API (HTML Canvas).
                On the right, the box is made using SVG, which requires creating
                DOM elements for the graphic elements (here a square).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="examplebox">
            <p>
                The differences will be more clear when we make
                the squares move. The visual appearance is the same,
                but the code is quite different.
            </p>
            <canvas id="canvas2" width="250px" height="200px" style="border:1px solid #000"></canvas>
            <svg id="svg2" width="250px" height="200px" style="border:1px solid #000"></svg>
            <p>
                These may look the same. But look at the Javascript.
                On the left, we use Canvas - an immediate mode API.
                We animate by redrawing.
                On the right, we use SVG where the square is an actual
                persistent object that is stored in the browser.
                We animate it by moving the square.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="examplebox">
            <p>
                The Canvas route has the advantage that it is simpler
                and faster (it doesn't have to create DOM elements for each thing).
                But SVG has other upsides. These boxes are created
                just in the HTML file - since I can create the DOM elements that way.
                The second one makes use of the style sheet that defines a class.
                Be sure to look at this html file to see what is happening.
                You will also need to look at the CSS style sheet.
            </p>
            <svg width="250px" height="200px" style="border:1px solid #000">
                <rect x="50" y="50" width="50" height="50" fill="#000"></rect>
            </svg>
            <svg width="250px" height="200px" style="border:1px solid #000">
                <rect x="50" y="50" width="50" height="50" class="lightbluewithborder"></rect>
            </svg>
    </div>

    <div class="examplebox">
        <p>
            Of course, we can access these SVG graphic elements like any
            other DOM element from javascript. 
            On the left, we change the position (as we did in earlier examples).
            On the right, we give the squares mouse handling functions. 
            Try moving your mouse over the squares.
        </p>
