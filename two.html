            A Tale of Two APIs
        </h1>

        <p>
        In this example, I will try to show the difference between two 
        very different APIs.
        </p>
        <p> 
            As far as the HTML is concerned, or even what you see, things should
            be very similar. But under the hood, they work in very different ways.

        <div>
            <h3>Canvas </h3>
            <canvas id="canvas1" width="400px" height="200px" style="border:1px solid #000"></canvas>
            <p>
                The rectangular region is for Canvas. 
                I'll write to it with an immediate mode API (HTML Canvas)
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
                <h3>SVG </h3>
                <svg id="svg1" width="400px" height="200px" style="border:1px solid #000"></svg>
                <p>
                    The rectangular region is for mySVG. 
                    I'll write to it by manipulating DOM objects inside of it.
