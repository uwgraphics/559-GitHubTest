    <p>
        This is the text of the first example for the 2019 example code.
        It's just a silly HTML file that has some HTML in it so we can do stuff
        to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        This file is also a reminder of how <b>ugly</b> unstyled HTML is!
        In a real application, we would use a style sheet
        (or maybe an entire framework like Bootstrap) to make things look nice.
    </p>

    <h2>Some Divs and Paragraphs</h2>
    <div id="div1">
        <p>
            This is a first example where we have an ID to change.
            <span id="span1">This text will be changed.</span>
            <span id="span2">This text will come from HTML.</span>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="div2"style="width:300px; border-style: solid">
        <p>
            This is a second paragraph. 
            It will have some more text so that we can experiment.
            But not too much, since it's just a silly example.
            It's mainly here so I can style the DIV element.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Buttons</h2>
    <div id="div3" style="width:500px; border-style: solid">
        <p>
            This div will actually have some action - we'll make
            a button!
        </p>
        <p>
            <button id="button1">Button 1</button> The button is inside a paragraph!
        </p>
        <p>
            The button by itself is pretty ugly. In a real program, we should style it
            and try to make a nice layout.
        </p>
        <p>
            By itself the button does nothing. This button has no Javascript with it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="div4" style="width:500px; border-style: solid">
            <p>
                Another ugly button.
            </p>
            <p>
                <button id="button2">Button 2</button> The button is inside a paragraph!
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll have Javascript find this button and make it do something.
                <span id="button2span">It hasn't yet.</span>
            </p>
    </div>
    <div id="div4" style="width:500px; border-style: solid">
            <p>
                Last time, we used onclick, which responded to the "click" event.
                This time, we'll be pickier - and try to observe when the mouse 
                goes down and up.
            </p>
            <p>
                <button id="button3">Button 3</button> The button is inside a paragraph!
            </p>
            <p>
                <span id="button3span">The button hasn't been pressed.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                The broken button behavior is part of clicking. If you move outside
                of a button, the mouseup event goes elsewhere. If you use onclick rather
                than onmouseup, you only get the up event if you got the down event.
            </p>
            <p>
                <button id="button4">Button 4</button> The button is inside a paragraph!
            </p>
            <p>
                <span id="button4span">The button hasn't been pressed.</span>
            </p>
    </div>
    <div id="div5" style="width:500px; border-style: solid">
        <p>
            Here will will show the difference between onclick and onmouseup. 
            Try clicking in each button and then moving outside. 
            Then try clicking outside the button and moving in. 
            Try clicking in one button and releasing in the other.
        </p>
        <p>
            <button id="button5mu">Mouse Up</button>
            <button id="button5oc">On Click</button>
        </p>
        <p><span id="b5s">No button pressed.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div id="div6" style="width:500px; border-style: solid">
        <p>
            We can get fancier by keeping track of mouse enter and
            exit events. Here, I'll check for the mouse leaving
            (but not re-entering).
        </p>
        <p>
            <button id="b6">Button 6</button>
        </p>
        <p><span id="b6s">No button pressed.</span></p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="div7" style="width:500px; border-style: solid">
        <p>
            Here, we'll let Javascript make the buttons!
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="span7"></span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="b7s">Some text for the button to change.</span>
        </p>
    </div>      
    
    <h3>Sliders</h3>
    <div id="ds1" style="width:500px; border-style: solid">
        <p>
            Everything that we did for buttons also works for sliders.
        </p>
        <p>
            <input type="range" min="0" max="100" id="sl1">
        </p>
        <p>
            The default sliders are pretty ugly. And they don't do anything without
            JavaScript.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="ds2" style="width:500px; border-style: solid">
        <p>
            Sliders generate events too. The most interesting one is change.
        </p>
        <p>
            <input type="range" min="0" max="100" id="sl2">
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="sl2a">Slider hasn't changed</span><br/>
            <span id="sl2b">Slider hasn't clicked</span><br/>
            <span id="sl2c">Slider hasn't mousedown</span><br/>
            <span id="sl2d">Slider hasn't input</span><br/>
        </p>
    </div>
